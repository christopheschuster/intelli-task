   The TSP is a classic optimization problem in computer science. Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

   This program uses a genetic algorithm to find an approximate solution to the TSP. It starts with a population of randomly generated routes and evolves the population over multiple generations to find better solutions iteratively.

   The code is organized as follows:

   1. Data Structures: Defines classes and data structures for routes, cities, and the population.
   2. Generation Initialization: Randomly generates an initial population of routes.
   3. Fitness Calculation: Evaluates the fitness (total distance) of each route in the population.
   4. Selection: Implements tournament selection to select parents for reproduction.
   5. Crossover: Implements ordered crossover to generate offspring from parents.
   6. Mutation: Implements swap mutation to introduce genetic diversity.
   7. Elitism: Preserves the best routes from each generation.
   8. Main Genetic Algorithm Loop: Executes the genetic algorithm by performing selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism iteratively.
   9. Utility Functions: Contains helper functions for distance calculation, shuffling arrays, and logging results.

   The code follows the best practices of object-oriented programming and modularization to improve readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

   This program can be executed by running the main() function at the end of the code.

   NOTE: This code is simplified for demonstration purposes. In practice, more advanced techniques and optimizations would be necessary to solve large-scale instances of the TSP effectively.
